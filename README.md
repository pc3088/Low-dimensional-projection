# Low-dimensional-projection

Given the Fasion-MNIST dataset, trained an unsupervised learning neural network that gives you a lower-dimensional representation (dimension - 10) of the images, after which tSNE from Scikit-Learn was used to bring the dimension down to 2. 
All the 10000 images were visualized in one single visualization in the image below:
